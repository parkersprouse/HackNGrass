# Hack N' Grass
My first game project, Hack N' Grass.

Hack N' Grass was made using the LibGDX library, written in Java. This was my very first game project. It's woefully incomplete and contains a lot of bugs and glitches, but it's something and I'm proud of my something.

Biggest known bug: Sometimes stepping on a button will not open the door that it is linked to, preventing the player from being able to continue through the level. I do not know what causes this bug, but I may go back one day and figure it out for old time's sake.
